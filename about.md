A little about myself:

I was born in Santiago, Chile and moved around the world for a bit before setting in Texas and graduating from the University of Texas at Austin where I studied physics and astronomy. I am a career-changer on a deep-dive to voraciously learn all that I can about web development and coding. I am currently a student at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. Hooray!

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to drop me a line.
