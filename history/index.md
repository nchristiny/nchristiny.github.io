Hi there, and thanks for visiting my humble history page. Like a good hero, (or nefarious villain,) everyone has an interesting backstory if you dig deep enough. 

Here is mine:

## Early years
 I was born in Chile during the middle of that country's brutal repression. Soon thereafter my family emigrated to Scotland, moving around Europe for a few years before setting in Texas in the nineties. I eventually become a naturalized citizen of these United States of America.

Having been touched by an authoritarian regime and seen the effects it had on my extended family and native country, I cultivated a lifelong appreciation for independence and freethinking, traits which have been critical in growing my passion for the scientific method, philosophy, and the arts. 

Allow me a starry-eyed aside: I cherish and value my adopted homeland, not least for the many opportunities and privileges it has afforded me in my lifetime. The promise of America, that of egalitarianism, inclusion and compassion lives brightly within naturalized citizens for we are in the unique position of being able to appreciate both sides of our time as Americans. I still treasure the little copy of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights that is given to every newly minted citizen, as I know many of my fellow naturalized Americans do. 

In regards to my budding interest in computers, my Dad was the catalyst for this. In Scotland during the '80s, I remember vividly playing a replica game of Pong[^fn-1] that he programmed in BASIC on a Spectrum ZX[^fn-2], which sported an amazing 16K memory expanded with a removable 32K daughter board. 

The games which were stored on magnetic tapes, just regular audio cassettes, would take entire minutes to load from the command line. This load time was excruciatingly long for my brother and I as children, but once loaded we got to enjoy the popping graphics of venerable video games like The Hobbit, Attic Attack, Potty Pigeon, Fantastic Voyage, Daley Thompson's Decathlon, Skool Daze, and many more. 

Incidentally many of these classic titles are available today online through one of many emulators[^fn-3]. Beware though, they are more often than not extremely difficult and definitely not the "EZ Mode" games that are put out today. ("Uphill through the snow both ways... get off my lawn.")

Years later on I would use the command line in DOS on an early PC compatible, Amstrad. I became a habitual BBS lurker and was introduced to the seedier side of the early web, with unfettered chatrooms were mysterious people traded "WareZ" and communicated in new and cryptic languages. 

I distinctly remember the day we hooked up two PCs together via serial cable. A simple game of Snake, where two moving snakes on the screen could be played simultaneously by two players on each computer, completely blew my young mind with the implications for the future. A future of multiple remote players in the same instance of a game. I was really excited about the implications. The year was 1988; I remember that because I  wrote a report on the Seoul Olympics that year on Ben Johnson's doping scandal. 

In primary education, I took a class Turbo Pascal, and as the Internet as we know it today became more accessible at the height of the dial-up era, I was using Bulletin Board Services regularly. 

At the time my interests lay in my childhood dream of becoming an astronomer, so I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a double major, Bachelor of Science Astronomy and Bachelor of Arts Physics. In college the programming I had exposure to was MATLAB and LabVIEW.
