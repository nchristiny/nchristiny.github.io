Wherein we continue the thrilling tale of my (non-superhero) origin story, thank you for reading.

## Entering the workforce
After college I obtained an engineering technician position at a silicon wafer chip fabrication plant in Austin. After being exposed to Lean manufacturing techniques, 5S Six Sigma methodology, Kaizen, as well as a whole bunch of gnarly chemicals working in the diffusion labs, the company faced the economic downturn of '08 by laying off a bunch of folk. 

I took a gig working as a web designer for an ad firm, designing and deploying commercial WordPress sites for small businesses in Florida and California. In retrospect the job would be better termed as a front end web developer as we were working on the LAMP stack.
