  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Nicholas Christiny and I love computers, astrophysics, and garlic.</p>
  <p>I was born in Santiago Chile and then moved with my family around the world extensively before settling and becoming a citizen of the USA, my adopted homeland. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin where I studied physics and astronomy. Recently I completed a training course through Dev Bootcamp in Chicago where we were taught how to code and build beautiful and meaningful things.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy thinking about extrasolar planetary weather patterns and time travel.</p>
  <p>Proud guardian of two cats, I currently reside in Chicago IL.</p>
