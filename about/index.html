  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Nicholas Christiny and I love computers, astrophysics, and garlic.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy thinking about extrasolar planetary weather patterns and time travel. Proud guardian of two cats, I currently reside in Chicago IL.</p>
  <p>A little background, I was born in Santiago Chile, raised in Scotland and moved with my family around extensively before settling and becoming a citizen of the USA. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin where I studied physics and astronomy.</p>
  <p>Ever since I was a wee lad I have been fascinated by computers, the promise of technology, science and science fiction. I remember distinctly with first time my dad programmed Pong in BASIC on our little Spectrum ZX. I also recall the awe I experienced later when I saw two remotely connected Amstrad PC computers playing a game of Snake simultaneously. Ever since these formative moments I have been hooked on learning the underlying machinations of these marvelous devices called computers. You could find me on early Bulletin Board Systems and Usenet groups trying to gain a foothold in this exciting world.</p>
  <p>As a teenager I elected, (seems amazing now that it was not required), classes like "Computer Literacy", where we would learn Turbo Pascal and play around with programs and concepts that I later recognized as algorithms.</p>
  <p>In college I followed my passion for science and studied the aforementioned physics and astronomy degrees. I still strongly have that passion, but also student debt. This led to various gigs to pay the bills, most recently working at Apple in Austin. After several years of self-teaching code on my spare time and running my own now-defunct WordPress web comic, I decided to become a career-changer and leapt into seriously learning code and development by enlisting with Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. It has been the best decision in my life.</p>
  <p>I recently (Spring 2015) quit my job at Apple in Austin working customer service in corporate, and moved to Chicago to level up my coding skills on a full-time basis. I completed the immersive training course offered at Dev Bootcamp on November 2015. We were taught how to code and build beautiful and meaningful things, but more importantly I learned how to pair/group program effectively, how to empathize with my fellow coders, and about current issues of inclusivity and diversity in the industry.</p>
  <p>I reckon the most important take-away from this wonderful bootcamp learning experience, apart from the character-building aspect, has been the refining of my meta-cognition skills, in other words: learning how to learn better. I feel like I can pick up any programming language quickly: just look up the docs and go! As a career-changer and early coder, I fully appreciate how valuable this skill will be.</p>
