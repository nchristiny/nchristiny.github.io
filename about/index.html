  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Nick Christiny and I love computers, astrophysics, and garlic.</p>
  <p>Born in Santiago Chile, I then moved around the world for a quite a while before setting and graduating from the University of Texas at Austin where I studied physics and astronomy. I recently completed a training course through Dev Bootcamp in Chicago where I learned how to code beautiful and meaningful things.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy thinking about extrasolar planetary weather patterns and time travel.</p>
  <p>I am the proud guardian of two cats and currently reside in Chicago IL.</p>
  <p>I can be found via:</p>
