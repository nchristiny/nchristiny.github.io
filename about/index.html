  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Nicholas Christiny and I love computers, astrophysics, and garlic.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy thinking about extrasolar planetary weather patterns and time travel. Proud guardian of two cats, I currently reside in Chicago IL.</p>
  <p>A little background, I was born in Santiago Chile, raised in Scotland and moved with my family around extensively before settling and becoming a citizen of the USA. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin where I studied physics and astronomy.</p>
  <p>Ever since I was a wee lad I have been fascinated by computers, the promise of technology, science and science fiction. I remember distinctly with first time my dad programmed Pong in BASIC on our little Spectrum ZX. I also recall the awe I experienced later when I saw two remotely connected Amstrad PC computers playing a game of Snake simultaneously. Ever since these formative moments I have been hooked on learning the underlying machinations of these marvelous devices called computers. You could find me on early Bulletin Board Services and Usenet groups trying to gain a foothold in this exciting world.</p>
  <p>As a teenager I elected, (seems amazing now that it was not required), classes like "Computer Literacy", where we would learn Turbo Pascal and play around with programs and concepts that I later recognized as algorithms.</p>
  <p>In college I followed my passion for science and studied the aforementioned physics and astronomy degrees. I still strongly have that passion, but also student debt. This led to various gigs to pay the bills, most recently working at Apple in Austin. After several years of learning code and running my own WordPress web comic, in 2015 I decided to become a career-changer, and leap into seriously learning code and web/software development by enlisting with Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. It has been the best decision in my life.</p>
