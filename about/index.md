Hi! My name is Nicholas Christiny and I love computers, astrophysics, and garlic. In my spare time I enjoy thinking about extrasolar planetary weather patterns and time travel. Proud guardian of two cats, I currently reside in Chicago IL.

If you would like to catch up on what I am doing most recently, please check out my [/now page]({{site.baseurl}}/now "now page"), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers).

Feel free to reach out to me via email or Twitter:

Site built on Jekyll theme Lanyon:

> In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). 
> There are currently two themes built on Poole:  
> [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) and [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)  
> Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

Thanks for stopping by!
