  <h1>What am I doing right now?</h1>
  <h2><i>Well, I'm glad you asked.</i></h2>
  <p>I am currently seeking full-time software/web development work as junior developer or with an apprenticeship. It boggles my mind the amount of tech meetups, conferences, startups and incubators etc that Chicago has to offer. Having already met so many cool new folks, I am happy to say Chicago has won me over and I plan on remaining here!</p>
  <p>Aside from my recent professional growth, I am practicing yoga, using my partner's spin-bike, playing guitar, and being a good cat-dad to two opinionated furballs.</p>
  <p>Now learning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AngularJS</li>
    <li>node.js</li>
    <li>Playing with various APIs for fun</li>
    <li>Ember</li>
    <li>React (Definitely seeing a pattern here)</li>
    <li>Improving accessibility</li>
    <li>Responsible web design</li>
  </ul>
