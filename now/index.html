  <h1>What am I doing right now?</h1>
  <h2><i>Well, I'm glad you asked.</i></h2>
  <p>I recently (May 2015) quit job at Apple in Austin working customer service in corporate, and moved to Chicago to level up my coding skills on a full-time basis. I completed the immersive training course at Dev Bootcamp November 2015. We were taught how to code and build beautiful and meaningful things, but more importantly I learned how to pair/group program effectively, how to empathize with my fellow coders, and about current issues of inclusivity and diversity in the industry.</p>
  <p>I reckon the most important take-away from this wonderful bootcamp learning experience, apart from the character-building aspect, has been the refining of my meta-cognition skills, in other words: learning how to learn better. I feel like I can pick up any programming language quickly: just look up the docs and go! As a career-changer and early coder, I fully appreciate how valuable this skill will be.</p>
  <p>I am currently seeking full-time software/web development work either junior developer or apprenticeship. It boggles my mind the amount of tech meetups, conferences, startups and incubators etc that Chicago has to offer. Having already met so many cool new folks, I am happy to say Chicago has won me over and I plan on remaining here!</p>
  <p>Aside from my professional growth, I am currently taking yoga, using my partner's spin-bike, playing guitar, and being a good cat-dad to two opinionated furballs.</p>
  <p>I am currently learning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AngularJS</li>
    <li>node.js</li>
    <li>Playing with various APIs for fun</li>
    <li>Ember</li>
    <li>React (Definitely seeing a pattern here)</li>
    <li>Improving accessibility</li>
    <li>Responsible web design</li>
  </ul>
