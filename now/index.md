Quite the quirky cavalcade of life events has transpired since I last wrote here. I've had great introspection and am loving life this summer. This year in our urban garden we are growing catnip, some tomatoes, basil, rosemary, and hot peppers. And a baby strawberry. 

I am celebrating my wins and pledge to always increase my compassion and empathy in all my interactions with my fellow beings. 

Now learning:
* Python all the things
* Thinking about quines a lot
* CSS Grid and stuff like that (flexbox)
* How to ridiculously over-engineer the blog format
