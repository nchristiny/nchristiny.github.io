# What are you doing right now?
I am sharpening my programming skills by branching out into new languages. I am using Android Studio to hack on since it is open source and well-documented. Incidentally this also means learning Java which is surprisingly easy to jump into after having learned other object-oriented languages. Onwards and upwards.

I'm also enjoying summer in Chicago! 

Now learning:

* Java
* Android development
* Python and SciPy Toolkits
