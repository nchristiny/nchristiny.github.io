# What am I doing right now?
Summer has started with beach days and grilling. Just got back from Geneâ€™s Sausage Shop & Delicatessen rooftop beer garden spending a sunny Friday afternoon catching up with a friend.

Currently playing around with creating a Jekyll CMS, and personal projects exploring React/Redux and Firebase.

Now learning:

* Python
* D3.js
