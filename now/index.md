# What are you doing right now?
Well, it finally got cold here for Autumn in Chicago, so I am drinking lots of tea and breaking out the space heater for our little Logan Square flat. 

I am continuing to volunteer mentoring to current students at Dev Bootcamp, something that feels quite rewarding. 

Also still volunteering at Free Greek Chicago: Getting dirty and learning (playing) with lots of hardware, getting into different [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) distributions and command line scripting.

Now learning:

* Online class Learning How To Learn from UC San Diego via Coursera
* Mentoring techniques
* Computer science fundamentals and brass tacks: algorithms, data types, etc
* Lots of new things I didn't know about in CSS(!)
* Python and Java, mostly in mobile development
* How to optimize my macOS developer environment
* Free Open Source Software (FOSS) alternatives
