# What am I doing right now?
## *Well, I'm glad you asked.*
I am currently seeking opportunities in web development or software engineering. The amount of tech meetups, conferences, startups and incubators etc that Chicago has to offer boggles my mind. Having already met so many cool new folks, I am happy to say Chicago has won me over and I plan on remaining here! Also I'm practicing yoga, spin-bike, playing guitar, and being a good cat-dad to two opinionated furballs.  

Now learning:

* Accessibility and responsive CSS frameworks
* AngularJS
* node.js
* Playing with various APIs for fun
