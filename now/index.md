Just on the heels of ThinkChicago and Chicago Ideas Week, Halloween and harvest time has brought us a bounty of fresh tomatoes and painfully hot jalape√±os from my little urban garden. Homemade salsa has made a regular appearance to our humble table.

I am settling into a new work position while expanding my academic horizons this semester with Analysis of Algorithms, a second semester graduate level course. 

Now learning:
* Algorithmic efficiency
* Recurrence relations
* Divide and conquer 
* Dynamic programming
* Chained Matrix Multiplication
* Sequence Matching
* Algorithms: Prim's, Dijkstra's, Floyd's
* Proof of correctness and optimization
