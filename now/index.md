# What am I doing right now?
It's a wet Chicago spring, so I am sowing jalape√±o pepper seeds for some urban garden window boxes. Up next are marigolds, lemongrass, and cilantro. 

Recently I caught the Van Gogh exhibition at Art Institute of Chicago, "Van Gogh's Bedrooms." It was quite inspiring and melancholy. Currently reading 'The Passionate Programer' by Chad Fowler and listening to Ruby Rogues podcast.
