# What am I doing right now?


In March I started an apprenticeship as software dev at Jellyvision! We've been challenged to make a JSON API back-end for a film recommender, using a React front-end. I chose to make my back-end using `rails-api` combined with MongoDB database. I am using `rest-client` to communicate with the front-end Rails app built with `react-rails`. 

Learning this has been both fun and quite exciting, given the limited time frame of 60 days. In the last 30 days we are creating an internal tool for the company.  

Now learning:

* React
* Redux
* Mongoid
* MongoDB
* CoffeeScript
* JSX
