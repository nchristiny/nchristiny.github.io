# What are you doing right now?
First snow has fallen late here in Chicago and I have been busy winterizing and buying Christmas presents. 

I am still volunteering at FreeGeek Chicago: Getting dirty and playing with lots of hardware, getting into different [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) distributions and command line scripting.

Now learning:

* CS50x, Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science, via edX
* Vanilla JavaScript techniques and when to use them
* CSS animation, and SVG properties
