# What are you doing right now?
Just got back from vacation in Dominican Republic, a beautiful place populated by beautiful people. 

I'm also ~~enjoying~~ dying from the summer in Chicago.

Now learning:

* More Java and Python!
* InfoSec practices and awareness of the many vulnerabilities to web apps and personal data. #hackinginprogress
* Using HackerRank to challenge myself and bone up on coding interview questions.
* To be more introspective and mindful and keeping a growth-mindset.
