# What am I doing right now?
Exploring Google Docs to add reCAPTCHA client-side integration into my blog comment form to forestall automated spam attacks. I've been lucky so far, so hoping to keep it that way. 

After researching about creating one's own CMS and the pros and cons associated with it, (many blog posts worth of information in of itself), I decided against reinventing the wheel right now and instead chose to keep working on nailing down features for my Rails API/React app pet project. 

Now learning:

* Python
* D3.js
* Django
