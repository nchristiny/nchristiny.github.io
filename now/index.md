# What are you doing right now?

I am taking classes in advanced Java and discrete mathematics at City Colleges in Chicago, and I am absolutely loving every minute of it! I plan to use this knowledge to fill in the gaps in my non-traditional computer science background.

Also currently applying to Georgia Tech for their Online Master of Science Computer Science (OMS CS) program. Hopefully I will be starting Spring 2018. 

Now learning:

* MORE Java! 
* Discrete maths!
* Time-management and soft skills!
