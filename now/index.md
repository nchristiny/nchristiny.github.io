# What are you doing right now?

I am enjoying the summer in Chicago by visiting the beaches on the lake, and going to school for my Masters in computer science! Recently loved visiting the Museum of Science and Industry, and attending a White Sox game with my brother. âš¾

Have been reading Kevin Mitnick's Ghost in the Wires.

Now learning:
