# What are you doing right now?
I am enjoying an unusually warm Midwest autumn. Been able to use the grill twice during October, which is saying much for Chicago!

I have been spending some time at Free Greek Chicago getting dirty and learning (playing) with lots of hardware, getting into different [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) distributions and command line scripting.

Now learning:

* New things concerning languages learned previously like CSS and Ruby
* Python and Java
* Going back to computer science brass tacks: algorithms, data types, etc
* Computer, app, and network security
* Mentoring techniques
* Optimizing my macOS developer environment
