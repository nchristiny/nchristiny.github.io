        <p>Hello. It has been, to be cliché, a real whirlwind of activity for me since starting Phase 1 a mere week ago. In fact, I have not had a chance to sit down and post here about it, such has been the trauma. My mind and body are still processing this alien environment and adapting to what the Dev Bootcamp (DBC) instructors term as the three learning zones: Comfort, Uncomfortable and Panic. I have been residing longer in the Panic Zone more than I'd like to admit. However, that is changing steadily.</p>

        <p>Naturally the goal is to hover in that "Uncomfy" Zone, which is where the best learning "experience points" can be scored. Luckily for our cohort, the program has gone through quite a few Agile-like product cycles and feedback loops such that with each new cohort, the curriculum changes almost on a week-by-week basis. </p>
        <p>It does seem incredible to me that when the program started there was no Phase 0. When we were discussing this topic with my Accountability Group during Phase 0, (members of my cohort Cicadas,) certain folk expressed puzzlement or at least questioned the need for a Phase 0 at all. I was not one who held this opinion at that time, and I am now even more firmly convinced of the necessity of a Phase 0 to facilitate on-boarding for early coders. I can definitively state that I would not have made it through Phase 1 Week 1 without Phase 0. As always, Your Mileage May Vary. </p>

        <p>I wish to post here to collect my thoughts and look back and realize how far I have come. I look back at code I wrote just 9 weeks ago at the beginning of Phase 0, and I cringe. I hope to also look back in 9 weeks at code that I am writing now, and cringe equally. Rightfully so, since although at times it feels like a <i>Sisyphean</i> task, the constant barrage of code challenges appear to be doing their intended work of loosening  neural bundles and multiplying connections.</p>

        <p>The reason it is so difficult in Week 1 of Phase 1, at least for me, is that you are adapting to yourself in this strange situation, and at the same time with the other people with whom you pair program. Over the weekend there was a grueling coding group project. The relentless pace is to be expected in such an accelerated learning environment as this, and it is exactly what each of us signed up for; however, knowing this information did not seem to make it any easier, funny enough. </p>

        <p>It is of course not all grim struggle and all work all the time. DBC is wonderful in providing certain times for us to blow off steam, to decompress. There is yoga, which I really love. There are gym passes provided, and lots of seemingly innocuous but in retrospect extremely important little fun activities that we engage in on a daily basis. I feel like others in my cohort may not feel the same way, especially about the yoga, but I feel like these aspects are just as important as the "learning code" pieces of the program. This brings me to our Engineering Empathy (EE) sessions with our on-site counselor, Erin.</p>

        <p>These are sessions that occur to allow the group to talk, share feelings and expose our vulnerabilities. If this sounds intimate and touchy-feely, that is because that is exactly what it is geared to do. There are a few online videos floating around with DBC founder Shereef Bishay and other instructors discussing Emotional Intelligence or EI. It is defined as "the ability to recognize one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different feelings and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence" title="Emotional Intelligence Wikipedia entry">Citation</a>.) Back when I was researching different coding bootcamps, this was the thing that most attracted and ultimately sold me on DBC. (Well, that and alum and now instructor Duke Greene's legendary rap blog posts.)</p>

        <p>You see here's the thing: </p>
        <p>There are now many places <em>like</em> DBC that teach you to code. There is only one Dev Bootcamp, that teaches you to code, but also how to combat self-doubt, to empathize in an effective manner, and to ultimately overcome your ingrained self-doubt. There are safe spaces specifically for anyone who wishes to just reach out and speak out about anything, without fear. Finally, and very importantly, the EE portion of the curriculum helps those of us from groups that are not traditionally marginalized in the tech/developer industry, for example men. Specifically they teach techniques on how to "un-learn" any internalized prejudices - in other words, how to become more aware of this tendency and how to work against it. They of course provide support and outreach for members from traditionally marginalized groups as well. I recently experienced a sort of liberating space to freely discuss issues and concerns as a Latin American in tech.</p>

        <p>If it seems like I have been gushing over the program just a bit, I will say that I have been steadily building myself back up after having been completely broken down in Week 1. I will do this. Thanks for reading.</p>
