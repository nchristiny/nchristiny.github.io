  <section>
    <p>
      I have only experienced one full week of Dev Bootcamp and it is the Phase 0 remote (off-site) section, but already I feel like it has been the best decision of my life and that I was right to take the deep dive into a career change by learning to code and amping up on a new skill-set.</p>
      <p>But it goes further; not only the immediate goal of career change, but a new way of learning to learn, to look beyond the horizon, and a whole changing of mindset. As the studies that we were encouraged to look into, the fixed mindset makes excuses when tough times roll around, while the fluid asks what can we learn. For me this type of education, one that deemphasizes test scores, and encourages radical thinking in order to come up with unheard of solutions is pretty much amazing.</p>
      <p> In fact, I have been wondering why I didn't make the decision to do this sooner. I felt like I was wasting away in my previous jobs, in a customer service background, (shout out to my brothers and sisters still in the trenches!) Please don't get me wrong: There is nothing wrong with working in customer service, loving and even excelling at it  - it just was not for me. Do what you love.
    </p>
        <p>
My expectations for Dev Bootcamp have only been heightened, but of course I feel nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is enough to say that  I think I am on the right path and will hold steady here for the rest of Dev Bootcamp. Good things are coming  and I could not be more excited.
    </p>
