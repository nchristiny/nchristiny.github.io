        <h3>Phase 0 ends!</h3> <!--Spiffy blurb-->
        <p>Crucial to our development as <a href="http://zedshaw.com/2015/06/16/early-vs-beginning-coders/" title="early vs beginning" target="_blank">early</a>, ahem, developers has been the ability to ask the right questions. These past nine weeks have for me been a culmination of a year and a half of self-paced learning, while striving to maintain my former day job. Since committing to the path of enlightenment and plunging into Dev Bootcamp full-time, I had the chance to spend more time focusing on the particulars of the learning experience, specifically on how to research and really <i>learn how to learn</i>. </p>

          <figcaption>To paraphrase Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.</figcaption>
        </figure> <!--Dynamite content-->
        <p>One of the things I learned was how to ask a good question on Stack Overflow, the Internet's hive mind, crowd-sourced repository of answers for all questions programming-related. </p>
        <p>The Reddit-style up-voting usually guarantees that a specific response widely considered the "best" rises to the top for all to see and marvel.</p>
        <p>This is great! As the popular Internet joke goes, all you have to do to be a good programmer is learn how to Google, and like most good jokes, it is not far from the truth.</p><p>The problem for newbies then becomes how to pose the right questions. I'll use an example from my old job in tech support. Usually customers would ask the customer-facing support reps really simple questions for which a simple Google search would often reveal a simple answer. Rinse, repeat. </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/it_people.gif" title="IT People - great show">
          <figcaption>My former life.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>However from time to time you would get a doozy of a question for which no one knew the answer and your Google-Fu would fall short. In these cases, you would roll up your sleeves and, to invoke yet another cliché, get down to brass tacks. </p><p>Often what was necessary was to figure out exactly what the customer was asking - expectations vs reality. The payoff for doing this would be the reward of finding a solution for a seemingly intractable problem, and this brings me back to the topic at hand, asking the right questions.</p>
        <p>Some Do's and Don'ts of asking questions might be in order here: </p>
        <h4>DON'T:</h4><p>WRITE IN ALL CAPS LIKE THIS, and say you are lost and that you need help, but never describe the actual problem.</p>
        <h4>DO:</h4><p>Be as descriptive as possible. Provide examples. And for the love of Indiana Jones, don't use caps lock.</p>
        <h4>DON'T:</h4><p>Simply state that "it" doesn't work.</p>
        <h4>DO:</h4><p>Again, provide as much information as possible. What doesn't work? What did you expect "it" to do? What are you doing when "it" stops working? And very importantly, what have you already tried to get "it" to work?</p>
        <h4>DON'T:</h4><p>Get frustrated and expect people to furnish the answers.</p>
        <h4>DO:</h4><p>Stay calm, take a walk, a break or whatever and come back. When you get back, take stock and provide more information in your questions, perhaps an example or two, (I hope there is a pattern emerging here.) </p><p>This last example is kind of a given since we are all here at Dev Bootcamp to do one thing, and that is to better ourselves through learning how to code, <i>vis-à-vis</i> learning how to learn. </p>
        <p>During this last week of Phase 0, we had a chance to catch our breath and were afforded some time for introspection- the calm before the storm. I am enjoying a quiet amazement in finally seeing certain concepts "click" in my mind. We have covered HTML, CSS, design principles, Git, Ruby, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, Object-Oriented Design. We also delved into cultural topics such as Impostor Syndrome, empathy during pair programming and everyday life, facing fears, and self-affirmation. It really is astounding once it is listed out like that.</p>
        <p>Although I will not claim to be an expert in any of these subjects, (OK, maybe the first two, HTML &amp; CSS, go on,) it is still quite amazing to think how far we have come. The flip side is that the more we learn and figure out, the more we see that there is still to go. Since this is a review week, I will make another blog post later to consolidate some of the learning resources I have accumulated and spread the wealth. Of knowledge.</p>
