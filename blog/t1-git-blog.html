        <h3>Pardon our dust. We are currently under construction.</h3> <!--Spiffy blurb-->
        <p>Upon embarking on this insane venture that is learning to code  at Dev Bootcamp here in Chicago, I knew this moment would come. We have been asked to create a written record of the things we see and experience and hopefully learn in our time here, (Go Cohort Cicadas!). Right now I am sleep deprived and cross eyed from exhaustion, all because of Murphy's Law.  Oh sure, blame poor old Murph, you may say. Yes. The utter bastard. Damn his eyes. </p>
        <p>To be fair the issues I had most trouble with were setting up  the coding environment, mostly due to my own ignorance and reliance on outdated information. Lessons learned. I must say that everyone in my cohort seems supportive, open and very welcoming. I was able to surmount my difficulties and plunge ahead. (The trouble appears to have originated in a common issue of not having the bash profile PATH variable look at the correct place for the newest version of git that I wanted to run. Nothing a quick Google search couldn't fix, but the issues later I experienced were all kind of this same nature - in that I indirectly caused them to happen, such as resolving merge conflicts etc.) </p>
        <p>This week at Dev Bootcamp we are wrapping up Phase 0 and we began with learning the almighty command line interface, hallowed be its name. Bit of background, as a child I first met this powerful entity in the form of a ZX Spectrum computer, delivering raw BASIC commands to a programs on magnetic tape. Games would take many minutes to load, (to my young mind it seemed like hours), after which input was performed via keyboard or 1-button joystick interface in glorious monochrome graphics. My father programmed a simulacrum of PONG and my brother and I were never the same again. Years later, I used the command line to bend the Amstrad PC to my will. I peered into hidden system folders and took great pleasure at "hacking" family member's user passwords, (nothing more than simply opening an unencrypted text file.) </p>
        <p> Yes, the command line was a fixture in our household, right up into the dawning of the commercial Internet. Suddenly Bulletin Board Services (BBSs) were available to whisk you away to some uncharted text-based adventure at a blazing dial up speed of 2400 baud.</p>
        <h4>But I digress, and will need to save these old-timey yarns for another time.</h4>

        <p>Sorry for the rambling, I wish to return to the second topic from this week, version control and the benefits it offers to programmers. We have here one of the most important and useful tools since the Charles Babbage decided abacuses were too pass√©. </p>
        <p>Modern version control as I understand it allows programmers to perform incremental edits to a project without messing up the main working project. It creates a separate "branch" that you may edit and work on and annotate for clarity on what changes took place. You may then keep the version you wish by taking a snapshot or "commit", and very importantly, annotate what changes took place for future reference. If a specific edit is not favorable, then it is easy to recover an earlier working version and see where it went wrong and correct it. After it has been confirmed to be good, it may be pushed back to the main branch. </p>
        <p>That's all well and dandy you may say, but I really don't care because I am not a programmer or a computer scientist. Well, my friend dear reader, if you have made it this far, it is because you may have captured an inkling of the possibilities offered by this marvelous tool. Have you ever considered becoming a programmer yourself? I can confirm from first-hand experience that it is Hard Work, but rewarding none-the-less.</p>
        <p>It is tough when you run into unforeseen issues, issues seemingly out of your control, but therein lies the rub: computers are stupid (well, that's changing soon but that is also another story). Most computers only do what we specifically tell them to do. Therefore, when something goes wrong, it is usually the humans' fault. PEBKAC was a well-worn phrase that was used in my technical support days: Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair. The solution of course at that point is to give up. Yes, just get up and get out from between that chair and keyboard and simply take a walk, run, swim, sun bath, anything whatsoever. Here at Dev Bootcamp we are encouraged to "unplug" as it were, to free up those embattled neurons so that they can loosen their connections and be ready to fight another day. Mindfulness meditation is in the curriculum and I practice it daily. </p>
        <p>Which brings us to Git. Git is the command line language from what I have learned, that uses version control on our local machines and is able to pull and push project data to other users or online repositories like GitHub. Git is distributed version control system, which is a bunch of florid words for saying it is a versatile way to preserve all the version of a project for future reference and to make sure everyone is on the same page. </p>
        <p>Developers use version control (git) and GitHub itself as a way of easily incrementally adding code to a given program which makes it easy to find points of failure, from what I've gathered. I can see that as programs become huge, that this would be an invaluable asset: being able to return to previous working versions if something "breaks", for whatever reason (Murphy's Law - see? I knew I had a point I was driving to make, thanks for sticking around).</p>
        <p>Tune in next week for more personal anecdotes and a peek at our week 2 curriculum. In the meantime, please enjoy the randomly generated placeholder images: </p>
