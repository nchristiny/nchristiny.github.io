        <h3>A tough subject to broach</h3> <!--Spiffy blurb-->
        <p>In many respects, it is tough to talk about the subject of Stereotype Threat to anyone who has not felt its effects. </p>
        <p>Just as a quick run-down on the theory, it states that any person of a traditionally marginalized group, be they ethnic minority, female, transgender, or <i>otaku</i> furry for instance, can feel the effects of the Stereotype Threat when placed in an academic setting, which causes them to under perform when compared to non-marginalized folks. </p>
        <p>For reading up on the extensive literature of this subject, please see: <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html" alt="Stereotype Threat defined">What is stereotype threat?</a><p></p><p>And: <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/" alt="The Stereotype Threat to Workplace Diversity">The study done by Dr. Claude Steele</a>.</p>

        <p>I have read the oftentimes animated and colorful discussions that crop up whenever the subject is broached - arguments against the conclusions of the studies that range from nurture vs. nature arguments, arguments of self-fulfilling prophesies and other so-called genetically ingrained reasons.</p>
        <p>However what most of the opponents to the conclusions of these studies have failed to account for is actual evidence to the contrary. Anyone who is of a scientific cast of mind must then see that their arguments hold little to no water and that they are arguing from a position of emotion (or worse) and not facts. </p>
        <p>I can only speak from my own experience, and will say that I have felt the Stereotype Threat when I moved to the U.S. at age 13, to Arlington Texas after having lived in Barcelona and attended a British private school. At the British private school, there were many minorities, mostly Indian kids. They were however not discriminated against and excelled academically, usually more so than the British kids. When I moved to Texas, the change in attitudes, from teachers to classmates, was palpable. It was seen as strange that I, a brown-skinned minority, was far more advanced in my studies than my peers and had placed into all-honors classes as one of only a couple of others in an all-white class.</p>
        <p>In spite of this I am happy to say I was able to excel and go on to college, but once there I again witnessed the same examples of the stereotype threat, to the point where I would see some of my Hispanic peers dropping out. The Stereotype Threat, from the evidence of the cited studies, is a contributing factor of lowered rates of graduation among minorities and I can say that I saw this first-hand. </p>
        <p>There is a reluctance in our society to ascribe this to institutional racism, and to blame any number of other factors. The fact remains that Stereotype Threat is a proven phenomenon and we should be mindful of its effects. Thanks for reading.</p>
