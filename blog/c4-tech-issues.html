  <p>Ah, yes, the perfect world of programming where your code always compiles and that framework always ships on time and there's never not a quick workaround.</p>
  <p>I'm joking of course, but all kidding aside, I wish to take a moment and discuss some rather serious occurences that I have witnessed in the few short weeks that I have started this long strange trip through Dev Bootcamp.</p>

<p>The root issue I wish to discuss is a familiar one to those of us familiar with the industry: a historical lack of diversity and inclusion of minority groups, women, and historically disenfranchised ethnic, racial and LGBT groups in general. There is a veritable dearth of successful minority and women programmers working in the high echelons of our most succesfull tech and developer companies. Yes, there is much progress being made, but the question may be asked, why is diversity such a good thing necesarily?  </p>

<p>It is a fact that the dev community is less diverse as whole that society at large. For answers as to why this might be a problem, look no further than open-source projects hosted on the popular programing site GitHub, the host of this humble blog.  </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I had a very revelatory learning experience by witnessing the full power of this lopsided and myopic way of seeing the world when a massive flamewar erupted on an issues thread concerning a GitHub open-source project, the name of which I shall redact for purposes I will explain below. </p>

<p>In summary, one of the project's contributers was called to task for espousing virulently anti transgender views, apparently on his spare time and via a popular public internet medium. A GitHub issue thread was opened to asked that he leave the project. Two camps were thus solidified around those who disagreed with having "offline", or non-dev related political or religious views being held against a contributer, and those who felt that this individual was actually doing more harm to the project by being party to it as a contributer and also that the project itself was being tarnished by the very fact that they appeared to refuse to take any measures against the individual in question. From the outset there was condescention and outright hostility from the project leaders as evidenced from the thread in question. These two intractible positions might have been yet reconciled had it not been for the cavalcade of predictable internet trolls that soon appeared and made civil discourse an impossibility. </p>

<p>As the flame war raged on, it became harder if not downright impossible to not see the extremly vocal, pro-hate speech, anti-transgender group as nothing more that grown trolls hiding behind a convenient shield of free-speech. In all segments of society you will encounter bigots; this is an unfortunate fact. However, I had hoped that there would have been less in the programming community, and I still believe there is, since pretty soon the pro-hate voices were being matched by those who charged that the project heads should disavow association with those who were now openly and proudly holding their bigotry against transgender folk. Threats and advocating extreme violence soon and predictably followed. This was when the line had been crossed and true dialogue degenerated. However, the issues thread was not locked and the flame war continued for many hours. </p>

<p>Unlike society at-large, the open source community polices itself and usually does a spectacular job. This is an issue that has been written about extensively by more capable writers than myself. Nevertheless, I should mention that as a new arrival to this world, I can see why there is such a great importance given to Codes of Conduct, and Community Guidelines. I am not referring to the hordes of internet trolls that stoked the flames of hate with adolescent glee in that GitHub issues thread, but rather to the passivity of the moderators and project leaders, and their apparent foot-dragging and reluctance to act. It was quite shameful to apprently just sit back and letting people issue deaththreats and slurs on their project's issues thread. </p>

<p>In the ensuing days and weeks, debate over the feasibility or appropriateness of Code of Conducts kept up, which further enlightened me on the fact that not everyone in the open source community believes in them. This was a real eye-opener for me; as a brand new developer, it provided a fascinating glimpse into the very problems that we at DBC have been striving to rectify, i.e. barriers to real progress, and the elmination of a dengerous undercurrent of animostiy towards minority groups and women, specifically the transphobia and the intolerance that is plainly seen in that incident. The open source community determines at which point free speech becomes simply a shield for hate speech. </p>

<p>Eventually the project in question implemented a Code of Conduct which many found "too little, too late"; even so, because of this token gesture, I have chosen to not name them here in this post. </p>

<p>The reason for this post was not to call anyone out or debate the merits of Codes of Conducts and whatnot. It was rather to ask everyone to take a step back, breathe, and think for what we are striving   and how far we have to go to achieve our goals. In closing, I would like to point out that I was heartened by the amount of people that spoke out during the incident against hate. </p>

<p>If anyone is interested in finding out more or wish to peruse the GitHub issues thread themselves, (374 comments), let me know. I'll be glad to send you a link.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
