        <h3>Current issues in the tech realm</h3> <!--Spiffy blurb-->
        <p>Ah, yes, the perfect world of programming where your code always compiles and that framework always ships on time and there's never not a quick workaround for an intractable problem.</p>
        <p>I'm joking of course, but all kidding aside, I wish to take a moment and discuss a rather serious occurrence that I witnessed via Twitter and GitHub in the few short weeks that I started this long strange trip through Dev Bootcamp.</p>
        <p>The root issue I wish to discuss is a familiar one to those of us familiar with the industry: a historical lack of diversity and inclusion of minority groups, women, and historically disenfranchised ethnic, racial and LGBT groups in general. There is a veritable dearth of successful minority and women programmers working in the high echelons of our most successful tech and developer companies. Yes, there is much progress being made, but the question may rightly be asked, "why is diversity necessarily such a good thing?"</p>
        <p>The answer is quite simply that not being diverse and not being inclusive directly hinders progress and allows us to fall into the familiar trap of excluding those who by dint of sexual orientation, gender, religion, nationality or whatever else are different. </p>
        <p>It is a fact that the dev community is less diverse as whole than society at large. For answers as to why this might be a problem, look no further than open-source projects hosted on the popular programing site GitHub, the host of this humble blog.  </p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, I had a very revelatory learning experience by witnessing the full power of this phenomenon as a massive argument erupted on an issues thread concerning a GitHub open-source project, the name of which I shall redact for purposes I will explain below. </p>
        <p>In summary, one of the project's contributers was called to task for espousing virulently anti transgender views apparently on his spare time and via a popular public Internet medium. A GitHub issue thread was opened to ask that he leave the project. Two camps were thus solidified around those who disagreed with having "offline" or non-dev related political or religious views being held against a contributer, (a not-altogether irrational viewpoint as I will explain in the next paragraph), and those who felt that this individual was actually doing more harm to the project by being party to it as a contributer and also that the project itself was being tarnished by the very fact that they appeared to refused to take any measures against the individual in question.</p>
        <p>In my mind as stated these two contrary positions have relative merits that are debatable and should be discussed. People should be able to separate their work and personal life. There should not be persecution for unpopular views. On the other hand, you should be held accountable for your actions in a public and society at large understands this.</p>
        <p>However, from the outset there was condescension and outright hostility from the moderator, one of the project leaders as evidenced from the thread in question. These two  positions might have been yet reconciled had it not been for the cavalcade of predictable Internet trolls that soon appeared and made civil discourse an impossibility. </p>
        <p>As the flame war raged on, it became harder if not downright impossible to not see the extremely vocal, pro-hate speech, anti-transgender camp as nothing more that grown trolls hiding behind a convenient shield of free-speech. I understand that many may have acted out of understandable desire to protect their project and their own- a circling of the wagons. However we must understand that at some point a rational person takes stock, evaluate the facts, and changes course if necessary. </p>
        <p>In all segments of society you will encounter bigots; this is an unfortunate fact. I was not idealistic enough to imagine that in the programming sector this was different, however I was heartened to see that pretty soon the pro-hate voices were being matched by those who charged that the project heads should disavow association with those who were by now openly and proudly holding their bigotry against transgender folk. Threats of extreme violence predictably followed. This was when the line had been crossed and true dialog degenerated. However, the issues thread was not locked by their moderator (who seemed to even relish interjecting their own commentary,) and the flame war continued for many hours. </p>
        <p>The open source community polices itself and usually does a spectacular job. This is a topic that has been written about extensively by more capable writers than myself. Nevertheless, I should mention that as a new arrival to this world, I can see why there is such a great importance given to Codes of Conduct and Community Guidelines. I am not referring to the hordes of Internet trolls that stoked the flames of hate with adolescent glee in that GitHub issues thread, but rather to the passivity of the moderators and project leaders, and their apparent foot-dragging and reluctance to act. It would seem to me that it was quite shameful to just sit back and letting people issue death threats and slurs on their own project's issues thread.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing days and weeks, debate over the feasibility or appropriateness of Code of Conducts kept going, which further enlightened me on the fact that not everyone in the open source community believes in them. This was a real eye-opener for me; as a brand new developer, it provided a fascinating glimpse into the very problems that we at Dev Bootcamp are working to rectify, i.e. barriers to real progress, and the elimination of a dangerous undercurrent of animosity towards minority groups and women in our industry, specifically the transphobia and the intolerance that was plainly seen in that incident. The open source community must determine at which point free speech becomes simply a shield for hate speech. </p>
        <p>Eventually the project in question implemented a Code of Conduct which many found "too little, too late"; even so, because of this token gesture, I have chosen to not name them here in this post.</p>
        <p>The reason for this post was not to call anyone out or debate the merits of Codes of Conducts and whatnot. It was rather to ask everyone to take a step back, breathe, and think for what we are striving and how far we have to go to achieve our goals. In closing, I would like to point out that I was heartened by the amount of people that spoke out during the incident against those who chose to spread hate.</p>
        <p>If anyone is interested in finding out more or wish to peruse the now-locked GitHub issues thread themselves, (374 comments), let me know. I'll be glad to send you a link via Twitter.</p>
        <p>This was a really long post, so thanks for reading!</p>
