        <h3>The power of positive thinking</h3> <!--Spiffy blurb-->
        <p>This week's cultural blog post is on a topic that is highly personal to me as a someone who suffered depression in the past - self-affirmation.</p>
        <p>This post is exceedingly difficult to write about since very few people outside my close family know about that side of me. It does seem strange that we can post most freely about our issues on anonymous message boards to strangers on the Internet and on micro-blogging services to people halfway across the globe, yet this holds the same therapeutic value as sitting on a psychiatrist's couch and simply talking.</p>
        <p>Having had the opportunity to speak freely to others has also made me hyper aware of not making any assumptions of others and the hidden struggles through which they may be passing, no matter what their outward appearances may indicate.</p>
        <p>I will add that although I am apprehensive for obvious reasons against placing medically sensitive information online where anyone (including potential employers) may find it, I do see that if I am to take Dev Bootcamp and the curriculum seriously then I must be, as mentioned in previous posts, brutally honest with myself: so here goes. </p>

          <figcaption>Words of wisdom to live by. Thank you, Chewie. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As stated in the paragraph we were asked to read, (<a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself" title="Encouraging self-affirmation">here</a>), "A general means for protecting the self from perceived threats and the consequences of failure is to allow people to affirm their self-worth."</p>
        <p>The question we are supposed to answer was: <q>When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</q> We were given a long list of accomplishments, from which I have selected a few, Accomplishment, Growth, Coolness under fire, Helping others, and Compassion.</p>
        <p>We were then asked to rate on a 5 point scale from Disagree to Agree, "In general, I try to live up to these values". I rate them as 5, Agree.</p>
        <p>Accomplishment is what I felt when I graduated from UT Austin with dual Bachelor degrees, in astronomy and physics. It is also what I felt when I finally took the oath of citizenship in 2007. These were very proud moments in my life, and I am extremely happy to have been able to share them with my folks, who worked the hardest in helping me get to those heights. This feeling of accomplishment has continued and was what I felt when I was accepted to Dev Bootcamp.</p>
        <p>For growth I defined it as the capacity to learn and expand my horizons. </p>
        <p>Coolness under fire, well, for this I worked for a while in customer service tech support for a major gaming company, and then for a well-known major computer and software manufacturer. You either had to have coolness under fire, or you just could not do the job.</p>
        <p>Helping others, I try to go out of my way at any opportunity to help those in need. I volunteered for a spell in Austin at a program for accessibility to the arts for disabled folks, and in college and high school we would also take time out to volunteer mostly for  homeless issues. </p>
        <p>Compassion; I called this one for my passion when it comes to activism with regards to political issues. As an Austin resident, we would often find time to go down to the Capitol steps and protest say a cut in education funding, a restrictive law or unwarranted militarism. I was quite the social activist until fairly recently. In my new hometown, Chicago, I am aware that there is a strong and vibrant tradition of social justice activism, but I have not had the time to investigate really, what with studying and all. </p>
        <p>This is getting a tad long, so I'll just run down that last questions: I honestly can't remember the last time someone asked for my advice. If my cats could talk, maybe.</p>
        <p><q>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</q> The answer is absolutely, yes.</p>
        <p><q>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</q> Yes, several. They are all pretty standard techniques, including the self-affirming one here. I use mediation, going for a walk, doing something nice for someone else. Calling your grandma. Talking to your plants while watering. Simple little things that help us get through the tough times.</p>
        <p> Thanks for reading!</p>
