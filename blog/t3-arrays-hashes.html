    <p>My goodness, it has been a week of hard work for me that just flew by. We have already reached the end of Unit 1. I can almost hear the collective sigh of relief from my fellow boots.</p>

    <p> <img src="http://thumb7.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/52377/140018635/stock-photo--year-periodical-cicadas-macro-horizontal-140018635.jpg" alt="Cicada: extremely loud when incredibly close">
Cicadas:  a great source for protein. </p>


     <p>Astonishingly, I have learned a full set of index flashcards full of terms that would have been Greek to me just a few weeks ago, but now I'm like "THIS IS SPARTA!". They include bash commands, Ruby methods, Git commands, and many HTML and CSS attributes and tags.</p>


        <p>I'm feeling up to the task of attempting to explain the main difference between an array and hashes in Ruby. </p>

        <p>From what I have gathered, in my extremely limited time as a student of the subject, an array consists of an ordered group of objects, (indexed by sequential integers,) as opposed to a hash which can be assigned any old index imaginable, numbers, strings, different types of fruit. <strike>The main thing is that hashes are not ordered, and arrays are.</strike> Edit: It is not strictly true that hash objects are unordered in recent versions of Ruby 1.9 onwards; hash preserves the <em>insertion order</em>, that is the order in which the collection was created originally. I am sure that there is a great reason for this, but I am very new to the art of Ruby programming, but I don't really understand it yet unfortunately. At first glance it would seem to violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" alt="Principle of least astonishment wikipedia ref.">principle of least astonishment</a>. This is due to being able to traverse the hash more efficiently, or something like that. We work with what we have, so I hereby amend my previous statement: both hash and array objects in Ruby preserve order.</p>

        <p>Apart from that they seem to able to be worked over with the usual Ruby heavy duty tools,  methods and their arguments. </p>
        <p>Right now we shall be enjoying this glorious 4th of July weekend without work and be back, with a vengeance.</p>

        <p>Arrays are all like: </p>

<span style="color: #75715e">#As you can see, well ordered to the point of fastidiousness </span>
</pre></div>



        <p>but Hashes are all:</p>

<span style="color: #75715e">#Hashes really do not care, do they? </span>
</pre></div>



<p>Again, I hope this somehow makes a lick of sense. I have a feeling I will be looking back at this in a few months and shake my head in shame. In fact, I'm doing so right now, but as Jake the Dog says:  </p>

        <p>Onwards and upwards. Stay safe &amp; have fun! </p>
