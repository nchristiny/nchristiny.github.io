  <h1>Week 3 Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
  <h2>Who will win?!</h2>
  <h4>June 28 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>My goodness, it has been a week of hard work for me that just flew by. We have already reached the end of Unit 1. I can almost hear the collective sigh of relief from my fellow boots.</p>

Cicadas:  a great source for protein. </p>


     <p>Astonishingly, I have learned a full set of index flashcards full of terms that would have been Greek to me just a few weeks ago, but now I'm like "THIS IS SPARTA!". They include bash commands, Ruby methods, Git commands, and many HTML and CSS attributes and tags.</p>


        <p>I'm feeling up to the task of attempting to explain the main difference between an array and hashes in Ruby. </p>

        <p>From what I have gathered, in my extremely limited time as a student of the subject, an array consists of an ordered group of objects, (indexed by sequential integers,) as opposed to a hash which can be assigned any old index imaginable, numbers, strings, different types of fruit. The main thing is that hashes are not ordered, and arrays are. I hope this is correct, otherwise I'll look back on this in six months and wonder just what was I thinking?</p>
        <p>Onwards and upwards. </p>
