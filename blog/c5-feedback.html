        <h3>Feedback is a gift</h3> <!--Spiffy blurb-->
        <p>One of the things we are encouraged to do at DBC is deliver and receive feedback on our pair programming sessions. What this has made me do is really think critically about "Imposter Syndrome".</p>
        <p>It's probably the issue that has been at the forefront recently for me lately. A lot has been written about this phenomenon in relation to the tech industry due to the influx of newly trained junior developers starting out.</p>
        <p>As a primer, here is a recent keynote from last April at PyCon 2015 by Jacob Kaplan-Moss, describing in detail this issue and the challenges that are faced.</p>
        <p>The part that really resonated with me is at <a href="https://youtu.be/hIJdFxYlEKE?t=709" title="Youtube Link" target="_blank">11:49 to about 18:00 </a>- (If you have time, I encourage everyone, especially those who are new to the field as I am, to watch his full 30 minute keynote presentation.) Kaplan-Moss really nails down what has been nagging me these past couple of weeks, to wit: that we often paint new programmers with one of two colors: you either suck at programming, or you are a rock star. In other words, that good programmers are born, not made via daily practice, dedication, commitment, and focus. His point is that this of course is a myth and a narrative that we as an industry tend to often believe. </p>
        <p>The feedback loop at DBC is encouraging to me in that it allows us to deliver honest and useful criticism to each other. Sure, there may have been frustrating moments during a particularly hard challenge, but you are not alone, you are sharing the experience with another  person who perhaps is at a higher level than you, perhaps not. The important part is that we are both acknowledging each other's presence and accepting of each one's ideas.</p>
        <p>I have received positive and not so positive feedback. We tend to naturally dwell on negative feedback more than the positive, and I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing as long as it does not consume you, or discourage you.</p>
        <p>As long as you are incrementally improving, then I think that is the measure of your success in a program of focused learning such as DBC, or in any system of learning. To put it in programming terms, you are effectively refactoring your programming techniques every time you adjust for the peer feedback that you receive. Programs grow and improve slowly, over each iteration; we should destroy the myth that any fully-formed perfect program springs to life immediately for any one person.</p>

        <p>When we were prepping for Phase-0, there were a couple of Dev Talks videos on giving and receiving feedback, and Engineering Empathy. The video is here, <a href="https://vimeo.com/76762772" title="Vimeo: EQ &amp; Feedback" title="link to presentation on Vimeo">@ minute 30:40</a>, (I recomend this whole video too for my fellow boots, if you have not wathced it,) where the instructor talks about the "Shit sandwich" phenomenon</a>  Basically, you don't want to just give negative feedback wrapped up by two pieces of positive feedback. If it has to be negative, we have respect the other person and be honest (specify the exact issue), but convey empathy and think about how you would feel receiving it (be kind) and finally make it useful (actionable).- in other words, make it Actionable, Specific and Kind, ASK (we love acronyms). </p>

        <p>This to me was one of the deciding factors in choosing Dev Bootcamp over the (by now) many other alternative learning academies and schools that are out there. The founder of DBC, Shereef Bishay says: <q>Feedback is a gift<q>. I have been learning exactly how true this is and what this means these last couple of weeks.</p>

        <p>The takeaway here is that we should be welcoming and downright thankful for any and all feedback we receive, especially that which is ASK (Actionable, Specific and Kind.) I cherish my received honest feedback, and I strive to do the same when I leave feedback for my fellow pairs. </p>
        <p>In closing I'd like to point to an <a href="https://dukegreene.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/how-to-fail-at-dev-bootcamp-and-how-to-succeed/" title="">amazing blog post written about a year ago</a> by Dev Bootcamp Alum Duke Greene, where he talks about some of the same issues we face with giving and receiving feedback. Thanks for reading! </p><!--Dynamite content-->
