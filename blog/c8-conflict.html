        <h3>Serious chat time</h3> <!--Spiffy blurb-->
        <p>This week for our cultural blog post assignment, we were encouraged to write about a time we experienced conflict, and a how we coped with it. </p>

        <p>If that sounds very much like an interview question, it is because it is a frequent one that I have heard used. I usually bring up an occasion where I had to meet a certain production goal and exceeded it by sheer grit, but I wish to go to a new place  with the question this time. </p>

        <p>I want to talk about a work conflict that I had with someone in my workgroup at a former job of mine. He was a manager with whom I would sometimes come into contact, and eventually work directly under, and he was problematic to say the least. </p>

        <p>The reason he was problematic to work with was not because of his style of managing or because he was difficult; on the contrary, this man was an able and professional manager, and quite frankly one of the best I had had at that company. I soon found out why he was so good at his job; he had to be - he was a registered sex offender.</p>

        <p>He had been employed with the company since before the violation and therefore apparently had some measure of protection from being fired outright (I believe that our Human Resources department was rightfully fearful of any possible legal suit if they dismissed him without proper grounds.) I do know that for those of us in the know, which was most of the office, it was very difficult to be objective and remain professional with this person. </p>

        <p>Upon analyzing the source of this conflict, it lay in the personal feeling that this individual was simply a monster - an unfeeling predator and that he was not someone that deserved common respect. This feeling stemmed from the fact that this person was a registered sex offender, a matter of public record, for an unspecified offense that had occurred seven years prior involving a minor.</p>

        <p>When you worked with this person you felt revulsion, but you could not help and feel forced to interact with this person. The part that made it worse was that he did his job extremely well. I know of several coworkers who flat-out refused to do cooperate and either applied to relocate within the company or just resigned.</p>

        <p>I could definitely see the position from where these coworkers were coming, however since I liked my job, I had to put aside my emotion and simply keep my head down and continue working.</p>

        <p>And so it was that we had the choice between being professional or allowing our emotions to rule our actions. There were various was of coping with this-  some rationalized, ("It was so long ago", "people deserve second chances", "we don't know the whole story"), and others simply refused to dwell on it, claimed ignorance, or simply went back to "not knowing", in other words denial. None of these comping mechanisms were compelling to me. </p>

        <p>Part of this exercise was to evaluate, "if you could go back, what would you have a done differently?"" It should go without saying, I find nothing more abhorrent than a sexual predator of those most vulnerable, children. Looking back, I did try to make a moral stand and went in to talk to upper management, to HR, and to anyone else who would listen; however everyone acknowledged it was a complicated issue, but that ultimately their hands were tied. If I had valued job security less than my moral principles, I suppose I would have done the same as some of my other former coworkers and resigned in protest. </p>

        <p>I wish that I could say that I believed in this individual had a chance for redemption or that he had "served time". I don't think that I am quite forgiving enough for that. This takes a lot of faith in humanity, in a higher power, and I hesitate to claim that I am that big of a person. I think that he was convicted of such a heinous crime that I doubt I could ever myself forgive such actions. However, I did learn that being professional and being an upstanding moral character is sometimes not the same thing. I had to suppress my moral indignation and this grated on me. I am happy to say that this individual departed the company shortly after I did for undisclosed reasons, so that others did not have to have the same conflict.</p>

        <p>This was a complicated issue to chat about. Thanks for reading.</p>
