If one wishes to stay abreast of the changing tech landscape in this age of decreased attention times and information overload, then a regular curated list of articles, links, or blog posts is invaluable. 

In my humble opinion these are the top newsletters out today that concern web development and software/hardware tech.<!-- more --> This list is a mix of development and design, software and hardware, news articles, tutorials, and blog posts.

The usual caveat that the Web is in a constant state of partial failure and is scattered with many defunct newsletters. [Natural law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) states that this list of links will quickly become out of date. Let me know any suggestions via email or Twitter.
